# cov19_tracker

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project focus on getting the real time data like total active cases, total confirmed cases, total recovered cases and total deaths due to Covid-19 in each country in the world.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## A Quick Guide 

Click on the icon to start the app. 
Then you will get to see a splash screen for 2 seconds.
The slash screen will redirect you to the main screen of the app.
There you will get to see the 'APPBAR' at the top then a quote then 'Total confirmed, active, recovered and death cases in the world' then the 'Top 5 Most Affected Countries'
in the world then the 'FAQS' page launcher and then the slogan of the app.
When you click on 'Regional', it will take you to a new screen.
In the new screen you will find the stats of every country.
You can either scoll and find the country that you want to see or else you can use the search icon at the top right corner of the app and type the name of the country who's 
data you want to see.
Now you can tap on the left arrow button at the top left corner of the app to return back to the main screen of the app.
Now you can scroll down and click on the 'FAQS' button at the near bottom of the current screen.
That button will redirect you to a new screen named 'FAQS'. In that screen you will get to see the most common asked questions and their answers.
Then to go back to the main screen of the app you can tap at the top left corner of the app(Left Arrow Buttton).
Then you can tap on the back button of your device to close the app.
